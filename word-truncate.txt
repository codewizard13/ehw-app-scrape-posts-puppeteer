You may not remember, but back in 2008 I had two dreams. In a nutshell, I saw a big battleship lying on its side in the middle of the ocean. It was the U.S.S. Constitution. I saw that the side of the ship which was exposed was very rusted. I understood that the rust represented corruption.
I thought, For sure this ship is going to sink. But then I saw God begin to paint the rust with an anti-rust paint. 
The next day, I saw the same thing, but this time there was a man standing on the ship painting it with the anti-rust paint. He had on overalls. I remember thinking, Standing on that rusty part is very dangerous because that man could fall through.
Donald Trump Will Finish the Job!
I asked the Lord, "Who is that man?" Then I kind of zoomed in and  saw Donald Trump. I was shocked! Remember, this was 2008.
Well, Donald Trump did get to do that job for a season, but he fell through the rust. We all saw this, didn't we?
On Friday, September 16, 2022, I saw God's arm and hand reach down into the ship and lift Donald Trump out of that place, bringing him up again to continue his job. It's a good time to pray  the "PUSH" and the VICTORY. (To read Kathie Walters' original post about President Trump click here.)
